Web Automation  
The idea of this is to create a small UI test automation suite, for a popular website (www.IMDb.com),  
using a tool/standard of your choice (preferably Selenium, or equivalent).

The tests should confirm:  
1. The Top 250 (http://www.imdb.com/chart/top) page returns at least 1 movie in the list  
2. The previous should be true, for each of the sorting options  
3. The previous should also be true, when navigating to the Western genre

Considerations:  
- the test suite may easily grow to 100â€™s of them    
- easy addition, debugging and maintenance
